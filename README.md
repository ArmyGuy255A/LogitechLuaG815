I wanted to take a stab at LUA just to get an idea of how it works. I own a G815 Logitech keyboard and noticed that I could customize its behaviors through a LUA script. I decided to make a script that would allow me to use the keyboard as a macro pad for my computer. I have a few macros that I use for work and I wanted to be able to use them on my laptop as well. I also wanted to be able to use the macros on my desktop without having to switch the keyboard over to it. This script allows me to do that.
